Overview
=========
* The Koala Bear is known to be one of the happiest Mammalia on the planet
* Quoala is a tool designed to dynamically assess its users mental health
* Questions asked by our client will determine a score given to users. This score will impact how we plan to manage their daily tasks.

Project Objectives
---------------------
With a few simple questions, and many tasks the user has to do, we want to simplify their day while providing mental health advice to keep them going!

  This is a test

Target Audience
---------------------
During our Brainstorm Phase, we aimed to provide an application for all ages. But due to limited time and resources, we decided to target ages between 14 - 25.

Understanding the Problems
---------------------------
* How to identify when someone is having a rough time psychologically
* The multiple variables that goes into a humans mental well-being
* Analyzing all the data the user provides about their life
* Ultimately, giving the best advice to the user, with a manageable task list for their day

Improvements and Learning Lessons
-----------------------------------
* Getting a head start on vocalizing ideas is a must.
* Decide on a development methodology before programming proved to be helpful.
* Creating a more robust program to handle user input
* Dynamically grabbing data from new research and data found in Mental Health studies
* Communication while working virtually

For the Future: Methodologies & More Devices
----------------------------------------------
* Bringing Fresh Research-Based Features and More Users
* We plan to conduct more research to determine our users outcomes and task lists.
* Making our app accessible across all devices will help us grow!
