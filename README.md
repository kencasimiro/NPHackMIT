**Quoala**

**Overview**

-The Koala Bear is known to be one of the happiest Mammalia on the planet
-Quoala is a tool designed to dynamically assess its users mental health
-Questions asked by our client will determine a score given to users. This score will impact how we plan to manage their daily tasks.

**Project Objectives**

With a few simple questions, and many tasks the user has to do, we want to simplify their day while providing mental health advice to keep them going!

**Target Audience**

During our Brainstorm Phase, we aimed to provide an application for all ages. But due to limited time and resources, we decided to target ages between 14-25^. 

**Understanding the Problems**

-How to identify when someone is having a rough time psychologically 
-The multiple variables that goes into a humans mental well-being
-Analyzing all the data the user provides about their life
-Ultimately, giving the best advice to the user, with a manageable task list for their day

**Improvements and Learning Lessons**

-Getting a headstart on vocalizing ideas is a must.
-Decide on a development methodology before programming proved to be helpful.
-Creating a more robust program to handle user input 
-Dynamically grabbing data from new research and data found in Mental Health studies
-Communication while working virtually
